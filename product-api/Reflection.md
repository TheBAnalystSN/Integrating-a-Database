# Reflection

## Project Summary

This project involved building a complete RESTful API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The API allows products to be created, read, updated, and deleted, and also includes advanced querying features such as filtering, sorting, and pagination.

---

## What I Learned

* How to structure a backend project using folders for configuration, models, and routes
* How to connect a Node.js application to MongoDB using Mongoose
* How to create Mongoose schemas with validation and default values
* How to build RESTful API routes using Express
* How to handle errors using try/catch blocks and proper HTTP status codes
* How to implement filtering, sorting, and pagination using query parameters

---

## Challenges

The most challenging part of this project was implementing the advanced querying logic. Building the query dynamically based on which parameters were provided required careful planning and testing.

---

## How I Solved Them

I broke the problem into smaller steps and tested each feature individually using Postman. Reviewing documentation and class examples helped clarify how Mongoose queries work.

---

## Testing

All API endpoints were tested using Postman. I tested creating products, retrieving single and multiple products, updating records, deleting records, and combining filters with sorting and pagination.

---

## What I Would Improve

With more time, I would:

* Add validation middleware
* Add pagination metadata (total count)
* Add unit tests

---

## Overall Takeaway

This project strengthened my understanding of backend development fundamentals and improved my confidence working with Express and MongoDB in a real-world style API.
